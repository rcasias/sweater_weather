        QUALITY HEALTH ADVISORY FOR WILDFIRE SMOKE FROM 800 AM\nMONDAY UNTIL 900 AM
        TUESDAY...\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has\nissued
        the following...\nWHAT...Air Quality Health Advisory for Wildfire Smoke.\nWHERE...Logan,
        Sedgwick, Phillips, Morgan, Washington, Yuma,\nElbert, Lincoln, Kit Carson,
        Cheyenne, Teller, El Paso, Pueblo,\nCrowley, Kiowa, Otero, Bent, Prowers,
        Huerfano, Las Animas, and\nBaca Counties. Locations include, but are not limited
        to Sterling,\nJulesburg, Holyoke, Fort Morgan, Akron, Wray, Kiowa, Hugo,\nBurlington,
        Cheyenne Wells, Pueblo, Ordway, Eads, La Junta, Las\nAnimas, Lamar, Walsenburg,
        Trinidad, and Springfield.\nWHEN...800 AM Monday August 09 to 900 AM Tuesday
        August 10\nIMPACTS...Heavy smoke from California wildfires will continue to\nmove
        into Colorado and spread across the plains of eastern\nColorado throughout
        the day on Monday and into Tuesday morning.\nExpect the heaviest smoke impacts
        in sheltered valley locations\nwhere atmospheric mixing is more limited. Some
        clearing is\nanticipated in areas of southern Colorado on Monday and Tuesday,\nhowever
        residual health impacts may linger from prolonged exposure\nto elevated smoke
        concentrations.\nHEALTH INFORMATION...Public Health Recommendations: If smoke
        is\nthick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain\nindoors.
        This is especially true for those with heart disease,\nrespiratory illnesses,
        the very young, and the elderly. Consider\nlimiting outdoor activity when
        moderate to heavy smoke is present.\nConsider relocating temporarily if smoke
        is present indoors and is\nmaking you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles
        in smoke in\nyour neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.","tags":["Air
